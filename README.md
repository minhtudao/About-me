# About-me
<p> Hi! I'm Dami, a 4th- year-student majoring in Economics at Okayama University in Japan. </p>

<p>I have interests in analyzing business problems and putting forward solutions for enterprises using data-driven approaches. I believe that the knowledge in I gained from my economics major would be best supplemental to the technical skills that I learned by myself. I'm working all the way to become an expert in the field of Data Science/ Data Engineering.
